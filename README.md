# AMT-CFG

Set and Map implementations based on the Array Mapped Trie (AMT) data structure.
A CFG implementation that encodes the CFG as an AMT Map is also included.
Currently only CFG built with MR-RePair are supported.

## Building

The project uses the [CMake](https://cmake.org/) meta-build system to generate build files specific to your environment.
Generate the build files as follows:
```bash
cmake -B build .
```
This will create a `build/` directory containing all the build files.

To build the code in using the files in the `build/` directory, run:
```bash
cmake --build build
```
This will generate an `AMT-CFG` executable in the `build/` directory.
If you make changes to the code, you only have to run this command to recompile the code.


## Running

`AMT-CFG` uses a command-line interface (CLI).
Its usage instructions are as follows:
```bash
Usage: AMT-CFG <CFG>
```
The `<CFG>` argument is a `.out` file generated by the MR-RePair program.

What the program outputs depends on what is currently being developed.
Generally, information for the user will be sent to the standard error and program outputs, such as strings generated from random access queries, will be sent to the standard output.
For this reason, it's recommended to always redirect the standard output to a file.
```bash
./build/AMT-CFG <CFG> > /dev/null
```
